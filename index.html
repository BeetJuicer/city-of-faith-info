                The Challenge
            </h2>
            <p>In an age where many young people are more engaged with digital entertainment than with Scripture, traditional means of discipleship often struggle to capture their attention. This has led to a growing gap in regular Bible reading and personal reflection, especially among the youth who need spiritual grounding in God’s Word.</p>

                Theology
            </h2>
            <p>City of Faith is grounded in the doctrines of grace and the conviction that Scripture alone is the ultimate authority for faith and life.

By shaping digital engagement around these biblical principles, City of Faith seeks to direct the hearts of players toward Christ, nurturing faith, obedience, and joy in Him.</p>
