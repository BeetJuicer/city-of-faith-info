## Our Story

City of Faith was born from a simple observation: while young people are increasingly disconnected from traditional religious practices, they remain deeply engaged with digital experiences and mobile games. We saw an opportunity to bridge this gap through innovative technology.

## The Vision

We envision a world where faith and technology work hand in hand to create meaningful spiritual experiences. Our goal is to make Bible study not just accessible, but genuinely engaging and relevant to the digital generation.

## How We're Different

### üéÆ Gamification Done Right
We don't just add points and badges to reading. We've created immersive gameplay experiences where biblical principles are naturally woven into engaging mechanics.

### üìö Scholarly Foundation
Our approach is grounded in:
- **Digital Spirituality** research
- **Self-Determination Theory**
- **Moral Foundations Theory**
- Modern pedagogical principles

### üåç Community-Centered
City of Faith isn't just a single-player experience. We're building a community where players can share their spiritual journey and grow together.
